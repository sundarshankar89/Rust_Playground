# Rust_Playground
Getting Started with RUST Programming


`cargo new Playground` creates a module named Playground

`cargo build` Builds the project and its modules and keeps the binary under `target` folder

`cargo run` will run the rust program and display the output

`cargo check` will only compile the program


`rustfmt` will format the code into rust standard 4 spaces, rust recommends not to use tabs
